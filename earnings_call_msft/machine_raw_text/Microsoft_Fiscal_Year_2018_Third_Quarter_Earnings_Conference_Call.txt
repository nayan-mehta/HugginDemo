and link den offset by a decline are intelligent cloud segment driven by a greater mix of our revenue fx positively impacted revenue growth by one point more than expected three points at the company and productivity and business processes level and two points from both intelligent cloud in more personal computing fx added two points of growth the cogs and operating expenses one point more
operating expenses grew ten percent and eight percent in constant currency as we continue to invest in commercial sales capacity cloud engineering and link dense even with accelerated pace of spend we increased operating margin two points year over year a direct result of our focused investments to drive top line growth now to the segment
revenue from productivity and business processes was approximately nine billion dollars increasing seventeen percent and fourteen percent in constant currency with better than expected results from office three sixty five commercial and link dense office commercial revenue grew double digits again this quarter a fourteen percent and twelve percent in constant currency unk including a couple of points from a greater mix of contracts with higher in

three percent and one percent in constant currency driven by customer demand for hybrid solutions as well as increasing virtualization needs resulting in the uptake of premium versions enterprise services revenue increased eight percent and five percent in constant currency with growth in premium support services and microsoft consulting services more than offsetting the continued decline in customer support agreements for windows server two thousand and three
segment gross margin dollars grew sixteen percent of fourteen percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage declined with the growing mix of azure i ask him past revenue mostly offset by another quarter of material improvement in azure gross margin operating expenses increased nine percent and seven percent in constant currency driven by our continued investment sales capacity and cloud engineering

pro revenue grew eleven percent in line with a strong commercial p c market we continue to see healthy enterprise demand for windows ten benefiting our o e m partners o of non pro revenue declined this quarter by eight percent below the consumer p c market driven by a higher mix of overpriced licenses and continued pressure and the entry level price category
tory levels were within the normal range windows commercial products and cloud services increased twenty one percent and seventeen percent in constant currency from strong double digit billings as well as the higher mix of in quarter reckoning from multiyear agreements the fundamentals of this business remained healthy was installed base growth and adoption of our security solutions as a reminder under account
six the windows commercial growth rate will have significant variability quarter to quarter due with relatively high mix of on premises licensing revenue search revenue x tack grew sixteen percent and fourteen percent in constant currency with higher revenue per search and search volume driven by being performance in the us and international markets subsurface revenue grew thirty two
two thousand and seven percent in constant currency with better than expected performance from surface book as we continue to transition lay as products in our portfolio and against the prior year comparable impacted by product end of life cycle dynamics gaming revenue increased eighteen percent and sixteen percent in constant currency due to x box software and services revenue growth of twenty four percent to twenty one percent in constant currency
and digital distribution as well as record levels and engagement driven by a third party title contributed better than expected software and services revenue we grew x box live monthly active users by thirteen percent to fifty nine million dollars will use or expansion across x box one windows ten and mobile platforms segment gross margin dollars increased thirteen percent and eleven percent in constant
in line with revenue growth segment gross margin percentage was relatively flat year on year operating expenses increased five percent in three percent in constant currency from investments and engineering across gaming search and i operating income grew twenty four percent and twenty percent in constant currency now back to total company results in line with our expectations
expenditures on a sequential basis with three point five billion dollars invested to support current and future growth of our cloud offerings cash paid for private property and equipment was two point nine billion dollars cash flow from operations was up fourteen percent driven by collections from strong billings growth free cash flow of nine point two billion dollars grew to slower
percent due to an increase in cash use for property plant in equipment other in common expenses was approximately three hundred and fifty million dollars from net recognize gains on investments and income from dividends and interest partially offset by interest expense our effective tax rate came in at fourteen percent due to a benefit from an r d tax credit we return to six point three billion dollars to shareholders through
share repurchases increasing total shareholder return by thirty seven percent we nearly double double our year over year amount fi back accelerating our pace from the prior quarter and now have roughly thirty billion dollars remaining of our current forty billion dollars share repurchase authorization now less turned to next quarters outlook first on fx assuming current rates remain say
effects to increase revenue growth by three points cox by one point and operating expenses by one point second we again expect strong performance from our commercial business with solid execution in our largest quarter of the year we expect commercial on our revenue to be up thirty eight two hundred and nine percent sequentially third on capex
all growth in capital expenditures on the cruel dollar basis as we continued to see strong demand signals globally finally we expect commercial cloud gross margin to be roughly flat to q three representing another quarter of material year over year improvement even with increasing azure revenue mix now to the segments and productive it
yes as we expect revenue between zero nine point five five billion dollar nine point seven five billion dollars we expect office commercial growth rates to normalize as we do not expect the same level of in quarter recognition on multiyear contracts as we saw in q three dynamics should see another quarter of double digit revenue growth driven dynamics three sixty five and linked in growth should remain high in intelligent
we expect revenue between zero eight point nine five and nine point one five billion dollars with another quarter of server products and cloud services revenue growth in the high teens as our hybrid cloud leadership continues to be a different share for customers we expect a total as your revenue growth to reflect a balance of our continued strength of infrastructure data and applications services and a moderating growth
are based services like e m s and more personal computing we expect ten point three to ten point six billion dollars across both o e m pro and non pro we anticipate trends in q three to continue into q four in our devices business we expect surface revenue growth in the high teens as we continue to transition to latest products in our portfolio
next to us he should see another mid teens revenue growth quarter as it has the entire year in gaming we expect a higher revenue growth rate in q three as we continue to benefit from third party game title performance and user engagement on our platform we expect cogs between nine point six zero nine point eight billion dollars including one point of growth from f x
operating expenses of nine point eight to nine point nine billion dollars with one point of growth from f x this would place a slightly above the high end of our prior range for the full year operating expense growth due to the impact from f x an incremental revenue driven expenses that support our continued strong top line growth in four we expect other income and expense to be approximately
eighty million dollars as we continue to take games or equities portfolio and earned dividend and interest income as we have in prior quarters we expect our effective tax rate in q four were to be approximately sixteen percent with some volatility in the final quarter of our fiscal year finally i want to offer a few early thoughts on fy nineteen assuming the macro environment remains consistent
of the key drivers of our business should remain intact revenue growth will continue to be driven by the transition to cloud services and within our commercial business strong execution and our differentiated hybrid position should bribe continued high teens growth in our server products and cloud services revenue k p i office three sixty five dynamics three sixty five
should also continue to drive double digit revenue growth in our productivity and business process the segment to gross margin percentage of every commercial cloud service will continue to improve with more improvement in as your i asked him pass consumption based services and less improvement in our per user saas services while we expect continued improvement in the overall commercial cloud gross
the revenue mix shift to as usual moderate the rate of improvement relative to fy eighteen we will continue to grow our investment in capital expenditures to meet the growing demand for our cloud services with the business results we delivered and the tremendous opportunities we see ahead we will continue to see growth in operating expenses in key areas discussed including link ten we expect
expenses to be slightly negative in fy nineteen as we not expect to have any significant equity games and lastly we continue to expect the full year fy nineteen effective tax rate to be slightly below the new us corporate tax rate of twenty one percent variability across the quarters do the mix of cloud versus license revenue and the timing of aqua desks and with that mike let's go to q a
thanks amy well now move over to q a operator can you please repeat your instructions ladies and gentlemen at this time we will be conducting the question and answer session would like to ask a question please press star one on your telephone keypad a confirmation tone went to keep that your line is in view you may press star to if we'd like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment and may be necessary to pick up your handset beef
canes our first question is coming from the line of heather bellini with goldman sachs please proceed with your question great thank you saw t amy you guys are seeing a really nice acceleration and intelligent cloud gross profit growth and with fifteen straight quarters now have triple digit premium services growth in azure i know you mentioned some some comment directional
margin ramp but how do we think about the pace of the ramp and gross margin expansion from here for this for azure and particular as you approach what we estimate to be roughly eight billion dollar business and annualized revenue and i guess what the other thing that would be helpful as when you think of the cogs of commercial cloud can you give us a rough ballpark of what percentage of cogs comes from capex depreciation
so maybe i thought and then they will have you re going to fill the numbers one of the things head up that's happening is that there is growth in azure across each of the legs and i think said this before sometimes when you have new workloads in new customers on board are based start with in some sense the os and the data more uh our blobs storage but then
higher layer services like our cause most db or even some of our compute higher level services like in i so that i think will continue because we are still in the early innings of the cloud transition we are investing aggressively whether it s on the fee side or on capex side to attract more customers and more workloads book customer so they will have that the same profile
is low margin services first higher margin services over time that s just inside of azure and of course you combine that with the rest one of the things that i think should be fairly clear is the high correlation between our services in office three six five as well as dynamics three six five around data in particular with azure so that's why we think of this is one
lay but that should give you a feel for how customers are looking at it and i think to your specific questions there were a couple in their heather and have you think about the portion of our commercial cloud gross margins that comes from depreciation it's best to think of it as roughly half and actually it's been going up as we began to get scale through these service
over time actually some of the fixed costs frankly even in cogs tends to come down as a percentage overtime because that should help you roughly to think about how much depreciation is of that number now would you think about some of the dynamics that we've been going through in the intelligent cloud segment particular the way i tend to think about that as you've seen and we are twenty percent growth this quarter in
product services k p i seventeen on a constant currency basis in our sort of confidence that you should continue to see that as i said into q four and then into fy nineteen is well i tend to think about that is will have significant revenue growth in that segment what significant gross margin dollars growth in that segment and you actually continue to see operating margin dollars growth at significant in that segment even as
vest intuit given the top line signal if you think about gross margins in particular what you'll see as you are continuing to be a growing percentage of the total revenue growth so even with significant improvement again in what thought he was talking about some of the lower level i ask him past services with an azure
inside you will see some gross margin percentage pressure in that segment through nineteen but with significant dollar growth
thanks thanks other we will take next question please thank you the next question is coming from the line of moral or with alliance bernstein please proceed with your question thank you very much and congrats on the quarter capex increased significantly this quarter two point nine billion and he said in cash on property and equipment we know that you build out you significantly invest in the data center footprint ahead of dim
you don t filled out the equipment itself at four in advance is is there a lord corporate a government requirement or is that the acceleration and then data centers at ended up quizzing that lift or is there something else driving as a followup how should we think about that for the next couple of quarters thanks
thanks for it i actually didn't think of it as a significant change in trajectory from what we expected a year ago q three was actually a little low on a year over year base i think it pops a little bit mark when on really a sequential basis i actually don't think to me it looks out of sorts especially with the type of demand we re seeing not just for azure but across all
our components those growth rates really at fifty eight percent on that total cloud number it's pretty good demand signal
basis so i hear you on a year over year basis but q three was a little funny a year ago on that front and we continue to really monitor the actually cute month and that supply chain and what have you any if anything there is a lot of automation and demanded sensing capability we have there and i would say mark while i appreciate your point that it takes
bill data centers in advance to the majority of the cost obviously in a data center is in the equipment inside and so while this really is the majority of this spend is is servers perfect thank you thanks mark operator please move to next question the next question is coming from the line of keith weiss
please proceed with your question the excellent thank you guys for taking the question and really nice quarter across the board is really not much to pick on in this quarter one of the highlights from my perspective is definitely lincoln harm and what seems to be an acceleration in revenue growth in washington so to target here one where are we in terms of debt acquisition is still
operating fetters an independent company or re starting to see some of the synergies position to specifically revenue synergies come to their from maybe even on our distribution channel that they get from microsoft or product integration so of synergy started to kick in number one number two given where we are in terms of the ma process on lengthen the appetite for further like large ma uh for from microsoft into going forward basis
thanks keith for the question let me start in the name you can add to this the first full it is very important for us to ensure that we did everything to enable linked in to keep that product and cultural eat also putting members first and innovating on their behalf in that was sort of our priority one two and three and that s
in their sessions growth engagement growth their quality member growth and obviously that all translates into the revenue growth as well across all of the marketing solutions talents solutions and sales solutions we also during that one you are done integrations you see i seed every day in my outlook mobile i see it
navigator in dynamics and so you will see and with windows stand so you will see us continue to do these integrations that add value again to both the microsoft three sixty five and dynamics users as well as linked in members and clearly that's increasing engagement as well that obviously then translates into revenue growth of those
so yes revenue synergies showing up but mostly because product synergies showing up and that s because of the product eat those of linked in around member first is what we have maintained throughout this integration and i would also add keys the link ten team is really done a tremendous job so let me say after a year of working with them closely my appreciation and frankly
a lot of inspiration that i think you've seen in our own product development has been their focus on users and how important it is and how focused they are on it in some of the products i would urge people to look at the outlook mobile experience and help really meaningful the experiences for the user in the member and i i think sometimes it's harder for us them
exactly what a revenue synergy means but i think i look at this and say at thirty seven percent growth rate plus some of the integrations we ve seen and the growth in uses and users have things like outlook mobile i believe that we're probably a little bit on the front end of the revenue synergies you'll see and product over time when it comes to
appetite for m ah i think it actually has remained unchanged which is when things meet our criteria and when we feel like it's in core areas for us were markets our expanding where the companies have a unique assets
we are ability to both execute on those and see them both execute on their own and execute inside microsoft actually feel still quite good that our we dont worry about our ability to do them but i wouldn't say that he knew this quarter and i think just dragged on that which is whether it's mind craft are linked in on many other acquisitions we have done this thought of <unk> uh i think the key thing we are very rare focused on
make this culturally accretive management teams accretive as well as revenue and that's where we uh building good muscle and we will continue on that professional thank you very much guys thanks keith we will take next question please thank you the next question is coming from the line of colonel care said with deutsche bank please proceed with your question
to start saw the team congrats on getting microsoft over ten percent organic growth that s a big achievement for a company that you're a scale and it looks like you're expecting the same for for the june quarter so congrats so i guess my question is in the spirit of this to a me on the overall growth margin trade off as you look into fiscal two thousand and nine eighteen any when i go back
say you had almost a year ago i left thinking that your messaging was really that you are going to press on revenue growth and and not on big margin leverage so im just wondering as we look into fiscal two thousand and nine eighteen is it correct to assume that that s a similar framework with the focus on top line growth and not to expect much in the way of of overall improvement in gross margins thank
thanks coral yes i think that's a fair interpretation of my commentary both last year end s which really speaks to consistency i do believe that the market that which we are operating the set of assets we've picked the team we've built the investments we've made in our sales force even some except the act
done these are all showing up as topline revenue growth for us you you see it this quarter you see it frankly in the guide and i think your interpretation that our focus on being a growth company even at our scale is certainly the right interpretation okay thanks for that thanks call
please move to next question thank you the next question is coming from a line of walter pritchard with citi please proceed with your question hi thank you i'm wondering if this combination amy and soft d f you can talk about the forward view of azure growth in how we should think about the drivers as we go into nineteen new customers exists in consumption premium services and i think we're going to
trait now and we saw that with officers to sixty five in the early days how should we expect business sort of level out over time is making inevitably well as we look to next year
yeah and i will start qualitatively and it's true that job we are at this point at scale on azure and with the very very high growth rates but as i said i think the key things that we think about his difference emotion of azure and each level because that s what is super important for us as we compete in this market print and more importantly for down on areas of differences and we have so the first
infrastructure side itself with the combination of the edge and the cloud i fully believe between as a stack and azure as well as inclusive of ah silver's we have the best crowd platform for what is going to be hybrid computing and will continue sean that so you will see growth which has got a different margin profile the they are about that is the place which we are very exciting
lot two consecutive quarters of growth in our higher level services but we now seeing some good scale for the first time talked about cosmos devi this was actually a database we just launched last year i mean are being around data basis for a long time i've never seen a product that scotland with this kind of scale this quickly and so we are very bullish about what can happen in the higher levels are
continue to build on that our peace but as i said one of the key things is architecturally the way we build azure the way we build office three six why there may be build our gaming cloud in the way we build even dynamics are all quite too much one architecture and and you see that even in the way customers use it so overall that deal
question on azure the growth will moderate as the numbers become vague and there were already become very big but that said we see plenty of opportunity for total gross margin growth in terms of dollars just because of the number of markets that we participated we can leave either they never participated in the also all and walter i think they you see that show up
at really and then my conversation on the point nine nineteen two saw his point really we talked about that server product unk a p i being highteens three rough nineteen we are really confident and double digit growth and the bp segment with the components of office three sixty five dynamics three and sixty five and linked to end so if you think about the
mary components of our commercial cloud overall we're certainly saying that it s a big business growing very fast
not counting then at fifty eight percent growth it certainly speaks to having a big bass and a big growth number on as you're you're right it will moderate through next year but because of the scale which it s operating that's why you still see that server k p i remain at that high level we've announced the base growth and so you will see also some different dynamics within that as
revenue number softly i mentioned the layers of azure if you think about the eye awesome past numbers i would expect to be on the higher ended rose growth rates and some of the services that are more per user like like e m s within the as reframe you would expect that growth to moderate somewhat more quickly just because it's a perceived business you will
time see us be able to continue to add arpu and growth and those segments thinking that almost like an office business internally we call that component part of our microsoft three hundred sixty five value that s how we sell a decks tonally even and so hopefully that helps give a little contacts to the number as well as our overall ability to continue to grow the sort of hybrid cloud opportunity high team
thank you thanks walter we will take the next question please say the next question is coming from the line of phil when flow with wells fargo please proceed with your question hey thanks for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter so i think you touched on the synergies that you're saying between the new applications businesses and and like helping helping to to add winning for your dog just sort of high level and strategically about
enterprise applications and an azure and how have you kind of see the synergy a pencil he coming up between those especially when you think i m l services of a kind of question is how important are how critical or applications like the growth that we are seeing in dynamics etc i mean one of the things that i talked about in my remarks this time was paula platform one of those areas of in fact real break out grow
in ca she can as being in a b i power apps and flow for the first time in fact in our own microsoft history we have an extensive ability model that is the same for office three sixty five and dynamics three six five this being a dream unmindful of i dont know if for fifteen years probably and we have finally here and we are executing super well for the interesting thing is it 's not just even
saas application it is the extent stability model for every saas application out including a common data model so i think that that's where the synergy lie because i starts with having a day to state that can really bring data from all of your application silos in some sense together so that you can start doing building either analytical power that you can then
and put it in the hands of people using our b i or run i model at dollars or some prediction that you can deploy in your system whether it s forecasting sales lean scoring what have you so that workflow we have every letter of it we have the best deployment tools and development tools in azure we out this common data model on top of this we have the best be i'll uh
technology so that's what you're seeing increasingly as the synergy but most importantly architectural benefit for customers because by having incoherence around these wears as where you may feel like you're making some great best of breed sort of choices in individual layers but he would bear that expense in your overall agility as well as your overall management of
and that's where i think we will be very differentiated great thanks thank let's move to next question please thank you the next question is coming from the line of ross macmillan with r b c capital markets
okay we'll move onto the next question which is coming from the line of brad reback with stifel please proceed with your question a great thanks very much maybe amy quick question the windows o e m pro business has an extraordinarily strong the last few quarters could you maybe give us just as of how penetrated you guys on the windows ten and corporate upgrade cycle on the sustainability
us thanks thanks spread let me first said i wouldn't say penetrations the word for this let me talk about this in two or even a couple of component pause when you think about windows ten what we've seen over the past couple of years is you're right a very strong enterprise deployments cycle and
for that product inside enterprises because of the security value prop of the product self when you see that deployment for security reasons and extra nallet he of that people often choose to upgrade machines in that in that process we ve been good demand inside commercial
entities for and when they make those upgrades to buy windows pcs and often surface devices in that choice i think it's benefited our o e m partners and us the portfolio of devices that are available are incredibly compelling i think our partners of debt a terrific job on that as well the overall economy is certainly also quite good
and the installed base that actually gotten older and so i think you what you are starting to see is a process whereby there is a great product there is a good macro environment and you've got customers who really want to move to a modern infrastructure a modern infrastructure has to both be secure additive
that can result as you re seeing that confluence of events in a very strong p c market with very strong pro performance in certainly the guide for your continues to imply all those factors great thanks very much thanks for taking the next question now please thank you our next question is coming from the line of michael nemeroff
yes please proceed with your question thanks for taking my question sat here and i mean can you help us understand the large revenue outperformance i'd for continued strong growth in gaming and amy could you please give us a sense of the margin profile of the areas of gaming that exceeded expectations and if you could also comment on the strength in the s p c margin in the context of the gaming margin as well that would be helpful thank you very much yeah and i can stay
because even on gaming very much like how we talk about some of our commercial segments we have gotten the strategy which really helps us articulate bought the growth opportunity as well as our investments across all of the various layers so first is the console itself or the highest engagement consul out in the marketplace so any time and new game whether its first body of the third part
the fact that x boxes were the best engagement is driven benefits are so as a platform or that great growth area for us but we dont stopped there because now we have whether it s x box live whether it s game pass or mix these are all additional opportunities to release of the game or i will as they play more games or or watch games on
so that's the other big opportunity for the last one which i think is new and is something which is already playing it s dividends on the average of growth side is we've taking all the knowledge of what it means to build twenty one of these first party titles of ours us and building it as a past service in azure our for game developers and the play five acquisitions speaks directly to that
those are all the various leverages we have n gaming and you will see it in the m p c segment and you will see it as i said increasingly lime even turn azure and i think michael if you don't mind i am going to expand your question a little bit because i dont think the increase in the m p c guidance simply gaming so let me talk a bit about the components and which ones i think a bit more sustainable in which one may have a temporal nature
the professor in q three and the guidance for q four shows actually for one performance and a number of places that we expect to continue o e m pro is a terrific example for the reasons i just gave and brad's question windows commercial which is really the business inside the enterprise of selling much of the secure revalue on a far more annuity like basis we have
double digit billings growth there and we expect that to continue into q four as well the next piece that i would say is a part of that sort of uplift in q four is our surface device the repair into surface cook too as well as surface pro with l t he has been quite good and you see us reflect that again in q four
as the comparable gets a little bit more difficult than it was in q three for us when you saw a very large growth rate were still expecting highteens there then you get to that gaming component and specific thought it was talking about the x box software and services component is where i would expect to see the impact of the continuation of q three part of that i want to be very clear is can
even going back a few quarters that has been a double digit growth or it will be a double digit growth or there will be some volatility in the number like anything else and third party hit games we will move it higher as they did this quarter and we are expecting in q four but there's also a really strong base to that business that is the result of what thought just talking about in terms of having a vibrant
with fans that believe in it and come to it with all the value that's been added that so helpful thank you very much in the great thanks thanks michael were moving next question please thank you the next question is from the line of rocks exelon with r b c capital markets please proceed with your question so much all flee the line is clear this time so such and amy i want
server products which was striking growth this quarter given the compound amy you talked about expected strength into fiscal q four and all of that i guess as testament testament to the sense of the kind of hybrid lead leadership you have the two questions though really is that strengths in server products broad based across windows server sequel server system center etc
sort of bias in the mix a few will in terms of what's driving the strength and then such you you mentioned cost most db and that was a striking number to me as well on i m curious do you think now you have the multi model database in market that that can help you take market share within the data management database space thanks yeah ma on on the second one
think that yes i mean cause most db is pretty unique capability or in the nation with everything else we do in both the data lair the ai layer and the infrastructure layer i think we have a tremendous opportunity because as i said the i r a is mostly first our data area and that's where i think the opportunity lies but to your pre
even debt and multiple trends here and amy referenced it in his remarks which is for example virtualization still continues to be a growth driver of silver products the other growth driver of silver products is cybersecurity and the security value in also overs so that's on the fact that we now have sequel and for example when you think about sequel itself it 's a hybrid
you can tear sequel databases with the cloud sequel is in i product because we had one database that actually allows you to write python than our in situ a store procedures right in your database so for example we talk about data and i close to data because computation will always go wherever data is and a lot of data shows up in relational data bases and we have a growth driver
and then there is the hybrid choice whether somebody is building a smart factory there now looking and say what is the sober i'd lie in the factory to manage the million dollars of sensors that event across the factory and that's where address tax shows up so multiple drivers of what is essentially the silver and cloud number in combination and to your point on net
the component the on prem component even with the top herbal doing well let me break side just common and sort of two drivers that have been actually more sustaining and as across both windows in particular are also sequel which are obviously the largest products within our seri portfolio the first exactly with hyper demand we have something called highbrow
hybrid benefits what it does is really provide confidence to our committed customers buying on prem servers that their transition to a hybrid to cloud over a period of their agreement is really about their choices their timelines in their confidence and so with that white is he lets them ease
between windows or sequel to those same benefits and azure with a small uplift in price i think that has actually been a core component the second one was virtualization drive or data center modernisation another one do move to prove me premium mix up of that so that if you wanted to break down into two more sustaining things that those types of the
number great thanks and this will be our last question thank our final question is coming from a line of kash rangan with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with your question last question will be the longest one really really really long thank you guys for getting in question for you saw the eye as you made with ceos of large companies so this is a recurring theme that we've been
other software company ceos the theme of digitisation can you help us understand just especially given that microsoft growth rate of accelerating where's the gdp growth it is as you d p growth rate so obviously the expanding our spending as a percentage of gdp or revenue average company revenue is going higher so can you help us given new video prospect pretty unique help us understand
line of i t that we have been operating in it comes to a digital business transformation water the phase one face to phase three initiatives like and where our companies like to spend more and what kinds of products and services that are new and are becoming or maybe you sell them today that come price that incremental swing factor over the baseline of what yesterday versus
to go with digitisation of business processes thank you yeah i mean i think when we talk to customers and seed c d o ceos what have you three dollars for digital transformation all outcomes in fact everything that we do across our solution areas are all ingredients i'll do helping our customers achieve digital transformation objectives on for example how do the n
summers when i talked about cosmo's d p growth costs must devi happens to be one of the best date of products to be able to capture the signal of that you want around your customers from a variety of different sources that gun one example of it the second piece is of course around empowering your employees i mean one of the things that now is increasingly become number one price
ceo is to make sure that the right tools the right products are in front of their own employee so the vacant do their very best walk and collaborate so teams growth is a great example of how companies are modernizing their work for the with things like microsoft three six five or the third one is operational efficiency when the dynamics three six five growth or <unk> i o d growth
taken every eye but he projected ends up as a few service project so that s a classic way somebody says let me send something predict something and then actually fix using feels so that's a transformational outcome will be a very well position and lastly people are business models you take somebody like an owl go a water you could say that a company but now they're pure
service company in other words they put sensors that allow them to actually deliver a very differentiated business model that customers and so that s the transformational outcomes we need and we feel we i'd microsoft were well positioned both with the technology but also with our frontline sales capability service capability and partner capacity to best address the digital transformation needs
wonderful it seems like c r m h c m e r p i t v's of the providence that are going to be driving your growth thank you very much very useful insightful thanks cash they're upset the q a portion of today's earnings call thank you for us and we look forward to speaking with already soon you can find additional details at the microsoft investor sins website thanks everyone thank you everyone ladies amended
conference again we thank you for your participation and you may disconnect your lines at this time
