the revenue growth in five points of gross margin growth with minimal impact on operating income growth excluding the costs but amortization of acquired intangibles link ten contributed one hundred and eleven million dollars operating income and continues to be accretive to e p s s fiscal year ahead of our original expectations across most geographies our results were in line with the overall improving macroeconomic trends
large markets including the u s western europe and france performed better than expected driven by commercial cloud momentum our sales teams and channel partners delivered another quarter of outstanding commercial results even as we continue to work through our sales reorganization from july our commercial revenue annuity mix improved by three points year over year too
sat with healthy renewal rates commercial bookings increased seven percent and four percent in constant currency even with a twenty percent smaller underlying exploration base from commercial unearned revenue came in slightly higher than expected at more than twenty point two billion dollars from growth in multi your customer commitments to azure commercial cloud revenue was
three billion growing fifty six percent year over year with broad based growth across geographic markets and customer segment gross margin increased by seven points to fifty five percent in line with seasonal trends we improved gross margin percentage in each cloud service and azure again saw the most significant margin improvement this quarter
margin was sixty two percent and flat year over year sales mix of higher margin products and services including better than expected performance from windows server and windows o e m pro combined with improving cloud margins offset the impact of a growing mix of cloud revenue linked and amortization cost and device launches the f x impact on company and segment revenue growth was in line with it
the weaker u s dollar increased revenue growth in less than one point f x had only one point of impact of operating expense growth less than expected this quarter operating expenses grew fourteen percent and thirteen percent in constant currency with ten points of growth from linked in including one hundred and fifty four million dollars of amortization expense we continued to increase investments in cloud engineering

services and microsoft consulting services was partially offset by declines in customer support agreements for windows server two thousand and three so segment gross dollar gross margin dollars grew thirteen percent and gross margin percentage declined slightly as the impact of increasing cloud revenue mix was mostly offset by material improvement and as our gross margin operating expenses grew three percent
constant currency from ongoing investments and sales capacity and caught engineering operating income increased twenty four percent in more personal computing revenue was twelve point two billion dollars up two percent with better than expected results driven by windows and search excluding phone revenue grew four percent our windows o e m business grew four percent this quarter
we expected o e m pro revenue reflects a stronger than anticipated commercial p c market bolstered by improve macro conditions and continued healthy enterprise windows ten deployments we benefited as well from higher mix of premium licenses and the timing of license purchases
revenue was down five points below the stabilizing consumer p c market we continue to see growth in the premium category in line with the market but heightened price competition all entry level devices contributed to lower volumes inventory levels remained in the normal range windows commercial products and cloud services declined four percent and five percent in constant currency mainly due to the impact of a large
prior year search revenue x tack grew fifteen percent from higher revenue per search driven by continued optimization of our advertising platform and search volume growth in both the us and international markets
grew one percent roughly flat and constant currency as we continue to transition our portfolio towards surface laptop pro with l t e and the new surface book to this holiday quarter graeme in gaming revenue grew eight percent mainly driven by harbor revenue growth to fourteen percent thirteen percent in constant currency from the launch of our premium console the x box one x x clarke software and service
four percent with continued monetization growth partially offset by our prior year first party triple a title launches segment gross margin dollars were roughly flat year over year with the decline in gaming offset by growth in search and surface segment gross margin percentage declined as expected with the console launch operating expenses increased two percent and one percent in constant currency
engineering investments and search hey i in gaming that were partially offset by declines and windows marketing and phone expenses operating income declined two percent as a reminder q two was the last quarter of phone comparability given the sale of feature phone business last year now back to the overall company results as expected our capital expenditures including finance leases increase
three point three billion dollars due to higher levels of customer demand and usage for our cloud services cash paid for property and equipment was two point six billion dollars free cash flow generation free cash flow grew this quarter twenty three percent driven by operating cash flow growth of twenty five percent free cash flow increased from higher customer collections following strong billings growth
working capital improvements in the hardware business and contribution from link den other income and expenses was four hundred and ninety million this quarter more than planned due to higher interest income our non g a a p effective tax rate this quarter was eighteen percent lower than anticipated driven by an audit settlement as well as a normal variability between service and license revenue mix geographic revenue mix
equity vast we return to five billion dollars to shareholders and share repurchases and dividends now let's turn to next quarters outlook assuming rates extending current rates remain stable we expect fx to increased revenue growth by two points caused by one point and operating expenses by one point with positive i t spent signals a strengthening commercial p c market
customer demand for hybrid cloud services we expect our commercial business to remain strong as we drive annuity growth expand our installed base and execute well on renewals we expect commercial on our revenue to be down approximately two to three percent sequentially in line with historic soon ality and argue story expiry base will return to year over year growth
commercial bookings growth third capex we will increase our capital expenditures to support increasing demand and capacity requirements on non accrual dollar basis we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter we expect year over year improvement and overall commercial cloud gross margin as as rim arjun improvement continues to offset an increasing next of as you will revenue
and productivity and business processes we expect revenue between eight point six and eight point eight billion dollars both office commercial and consumer revenue growth will be driven by officers to sixty five with growth rates for each consistent with the q two we expect double digit dynamics revenue growth from the shift to dynamics three to sixty five link ten should deliver approximately one point two billion dollars growing more than twenty
and intelligent cloud we expect revenue between seven point five five and seven point seven five billion dollars with strong double digit revenue growth in server products and cloud services and enterprise services we expect to revenue growth rate similar to q two as growth and premier support should offset the decline of windows two thousand and three customer support agreements
computing we expect revenue between zero nine point one two nine point four billion dollars in windows we expect o e m revenue to be largely align with the total p c market both o e m pro revenue and non pro revenue should be impacted by similar dynamic seen in q two now two devices surface revenue should grow year over year for continue to launch momentum from
pro book and laptop but declined sequentially consistent with the holiday seasonality in search x taxi we expect a similar strong rate of revenue growth to q two in gaming we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter but with a revenue mix shift to software and services and continued year over year growth of our x box live user base we expect cogs
and nine point two billion dollars including one point of f x headwinds we expect operating expenses of nine point one two nine point two billion dollars including one point of f x headwinds given the opportunity ahead of us and our execution to date we will continue to invest intelligent cloud intelligent edge ai and our sales teams to drive to sustainable top line growth
other in common expense should be approximately three hundred and fifty million dollars as we continue to take gains are equities portfolio and earn dividend and interest income this is lower than we previously expected reflecting the impact of rising interest rates on our fixed income portfolio now a few comments on the fiscal year first given our outperformance in the first half of the year we are now ahead of our previous expect
year gross margin we are now trending to be roughly flat year over year including link ten second we still expect full year operating expenses including link them between zero dollars and six point four and thirty six point seven billion dollars we are confident in this investment given our significant growth opportunities consistent execution and strong competitive position
operating margin we are again trending ahead of our previous guidance we now expect company operating margin including link ten to be slightly up year over year excluding length dem company operating margin should improve by more than a point for the tax rate the face in our current understanding of the recently enacted tax law we now exp
tax rate for h two to be sixteen percent plus or minus two points for fy nineteen we expect our full year effective tax rate to be slightly below the new us corporate rate of twenty one percent due to the impact of tax law provisions effective for us july first two thousand and eighteen we will continue to have quarterly variability based on
visible license revenue geographic mix of revenue and the timing of equity vest finally we remain consistent in our ongoing commitment to capital return as always we believe the highest shareholder value is created first through organic and inorganic investment to pursue pursue pursue the significant market opportunities ahead and are proud of our resource al
his and the results and we ve been focused on capital return through both dividends and share repurchases a key part of our commitment to total share with hope for the return for many years with the recent tax reform we can continue that commitment without the need to access the capital markets before trying to q a i have one special thank you chris size moving to a
as the senior finance leader of our azure and server business on behalf of the company thank you for your significant impact on investor relations for the past five years and i'd like to welcome my expense or the former finance leader of our office three sixty five business as the new head of investor relations we look forward to having you lead the team now chris let's go to q a
thanks amy will now move to a writer can you please repeat your instructions thank you will now be conducting a question and answer session if you'd like to ask a question is press star one on your telephone keypad and confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question q press star to lie to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment it may be necessary to pick up your hands that were for pressing the star cues
our first question comes from the line of karl keirstead with deutsche bank please proceed thanks very much and congratulations on the results so relative to your guidance over half the beat this quarter came in the intelligent cloud segment so i wouldn't mind digging in there a little bit and it wasn't just the the amazing azure performance year on from server product business accelerate
the cautious commentary about a tough comp on the last call even enterprise services was plus three instead of flat and your guide actually suggest that that goodness in intelligent cloud should continue next quarter despite actually away to for comp so im just curious amy or satya if there's any threads that you can we through this intelligent cloud outperformance
broader increase in enterprise spend in the december quarter any change in behavior or is all of this goodness a little bit more microsoft specific any you called out i t spending signal so i'm guessing maybe a little bit was macro thank you thanks call let me start and as we can add for me it all comes down to really
an architectural advantage on what is a new secular trend so when we think about the intelligent cloud in the intelligent edge and then bring that to the asia business you can see it at each layer of when it comes into the infrastructure were the only cloud provider that provides true hybrid cloud computing with azure and as you stack when it comes to the dated tr we
neatness sick something like cost most d v d the only planets scale database that s multi models supports these new programming models of silver less than they've been driven programming take sequel what we are seeing in terms the sequel growth in terms of azure db as well as sequence of or and sequels over on linux that's again addressing the customer needs
their new workloads that are being born that required both the cloud and the edge our i r t v in a great example of that and especially when you take that in combination with i again you train on the cloud and you score on the edge that s are real competitive advantage we have everything from sort of the lifecycle management of how these models get created in deployed
so i think that's what you're seeing they will be variability quarter to quarter they will be mixed differences but overall when i look at what is it that we need to get done is innovate on what is upon the metal architectural advantage to where the world is going and i would say coral a couple of things we've been investing here both an engineer
differentiation that thought we just talked about in sales resources and then continuing to invest in technical sales resources that can help our customers be successful and these deployment i actually think you're a continuing to see the impact of those investments growing in time and growing and expertise and so i feel encouraged both by the technical differentiation but all
turn on the investments we've made here that lead us to have a good amount of confidence that you do see in the guide in q three and yes you're right we do have a tougher comparable particularly on prem in q three which is correct okay thank you but oh thanks will move to the next question please
our next question comes from line of keith weiss morgan stanley please proceed hi susan thank you guys for taking the question very again in really not solid quarter and chris has been on great working with you sorry if you go from this role as to my questions one question for sought a and is starting a little bit now maybe running off from there
gaming in the quarter to sort of had a good quarter for gaming with the x box launch but more broadly there is some murmurings out there about x box falling behind playstation if you look at the sort of the bases of those two consoled there is a murmurings about not having enough kind of exclusive games on the console i know you sort of mix a bull leadership a little bit there how do you feel about your positioning in
from a narrow focus in the more broadly how are you guys feeling about your position in the home if you will when i go home i'm talking to election that talking to court on it is that s something that that you're comfortable with where we are today that's something we should see improving on going forward basis thanks keep so let me take both of those questions so on gaming we feel good about x box one x
premium console launch we also feel got the volume we got the war x box one s because we always wanted him effect of the premium called sold driving even lower end consol because that creates
for gaming for us but our real our strategy going forward is not only to do great work on the comps sold for to complement that with the work we are doing on the pc pc gaming is growth market and so therefore you see us whether it s subscription off but then it s all streaming efforts that are increasingly bringing the console plus pc together and then not stopping there but
devices and for example mobile but mind craft on mobile we just launched in fact in the last quarter in china obvious seeing tremendous growth of mind graphic expansion on mobile platform in china so overall you will see us do good work on council will compete there but more importantly we have a much more brought a gaming view in terms of what val
without subscription services streaming services across all devices and one other point i think i made in my remarks earlier is gaming also is a growth area for azure in other words we have now increasing past services that we are going to reinforce the azure and attract more game developers some of the know how that we have from x box is not just about the x box but it s going to
first across the board so that i think we'll also trends and our leading to even media company so we are very excited about some of what we can get out of our investments in gaming so that s a focus on gaming into the court on a in home now i think is probably important although the question all off you off did now only but my investment so much broader in other words i first start by saying let's make sure
i capability whether it's speech whether ultimately even image recognition and dialogue management because right now most assistance of fairly dom in terms of just doing one to dialogue but where we want to go with multi turn dialogue and that requires real natural language understanding so all of those investments for example are available on azure as cognitive sir
even referenced in my remarks how when health g a a p people are using those to build thoughts and skills and agents that's where we will make sure we do our best but building blocks and i work of course it would manifest for off with court on a as an agent from microsoft that has some special skills especially around that crossover between work in life
and then knowledge or smarts come from the data access to have in our case it s going to be about things that i didn't office three six five the people places things and how we reason about it and help users whether that at home or whether they did work lastly even webcams two devices we want to take an approach that brings all assistance that s why we are working
al aqsa we would well comment on our devices because we believe in a world where our own assistance should be available everywhere and so she had other assistance be available on our devices were says thinking that the endgame here is about speaking are doing one turn dialogues on one speaker in one hole that 's just not our vision
will move to the next question please thank you our next question comes from line of mark logan whatever may be please proceed with your question no problem thank you congrats first on the great quarter and chris thanks and congratulations on the new position should be greatly successful sofya <unk> like to ask a question can you give a sense of
what is the adoption of azure in the us versus international that just new revenue point of view but in terms of the mix of premium workloads types of workloads at said or how should we think of where we are in that process i would say the us has been a lead market in general when it comes to
to technology and architectural paradigm adoption by deflect take something like i or the higher level services are on data we clearly see first things happening in in you ask and quickly followed by geographies like germany in the uk that also done workloads like the i r workload where we do see an
advanced action in countries like germany especially or with the industrial customers in terms of swaps mark factories japan but i think broadly i dont see any difference than say what we used to see or what we still on our sober or any other technology adoption curves and they have differences in industry
different industries have strong in different parts of the global so and then they they represent different use cases in terms of the components of azure that get used from thank you for like you thanks mike we'll we'll take the next question please prairie thank you our next question comes from line of heather bellini with goldman sachs please proceed great thank you too
amy i guess you ve been talking about and so as are about the commercial bookings were the expiry base was down over year over year gun a year over year basis im just wondering if you look ahead to two thousand and nine pain is there anything you could share with those about the size of the expiry base in that period just that we could think about it i know you don t v guidance that far up but just as we start to think about thinking about further out growth and then i guess the other question would be
you mentioned better ip spending but just also given the significant savings companies in the us are going to be seeing due to lower tax bills is there any early feedback from partners our customers about the rate that this might be reinvested back into ip spending and digitisation thank you thanks heather
general fy nineteen will have a higher base the in fy eighteen just as you start to think through the impacts on bookings for the next year and as we talked about q three has that same attribute it is higher than it was a year ago q two the reason we called it out obviously because it was such an outlier and if you look back three years so it's just sort of how this yeah expiry base works
performance this quarter was really strong compared to three years ago so i feel great about our sales execution is specially in terms of growing the recapture rate at accounts to your question on the demand signals were seeing in the us in particular i think it is quite early but as we've said the us has been a good market for us
market for us for a good period of time and it was again in q two as we noted and i think we are optimistic as we look to h two when we see the signals we are seeing in the market whether it's pcs server or the or the cloud demand thank you
next question earlier <unk> corp thank you our next question comes from line of still winslow with wells fargo please proceed hi thanks thanks for taking my question and congrats not just on the income statement health obviously the balance sheet were obviously the commercial i was only down five percent for so you guys seven so i congrats their focus this is actually on the commercial side of it specifically on on office obviously office three six five revenue
pay see growth there we ve talked about the past with pricing but if i just look at all so overall office on the commercial side up temp up ten percent of the same payments q one when you all think about going forward just a mix of those two obviously the on prem business still declining in the high teens and then office three six five growing rapidly how do you think about just the blended growth of office commercial in the puts and takes there
this is this is one where i tend to what i think about that ten percent number it it really is same way i think about office three sixty five our goal and i think the real opportunity that remains with the officer and sixty five percent and microsoft three hundred sixty five going forward is our ability to continue to grow the install base and to all
to new to grow our arpu the combination of those two things and the opportunity we see is the reason in the sales remark that we didn't july we continue to put resources and sales resources the hind collaboration and communication and so many of the important workloads that allow
to give great value to customers and even started to see at this quarter as reporting out till we saw a little bit more impact of q five this quarter in arpu than we had been sang it 's been in the market a while we're seeing that momentum the value all up of you five not just from an office perspective from microsoft is sixty five perspective with security and management
well as some of the newer products that are getting some strong adoption like teams i think we've got a really good about where we are and the value in our opportunity both from from small business up to the large enterprise from first line workers to do all of these do all these things that continue to execute well so the guide certainly implies that continued optimism
thanks thanks so we will go to the next question please thank you our next question comes from line of ramo than shell with barclays please proceed thanks for taking my question and all the best for you chris i just wanted to double click on the productivity gains you seeing the cloud especially on azure can you talk a little bit of bounded drivers dear i know one is
build out pattern was different than some of your competitors so were you filling capacity but also talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of how you are delivering services in azure and how that s evolving thank you i mean overall you'll be did take an approach that we want to make sure we meet the real world needs across the globe and will continue to do salt when we look at our
then we want to make sure but the data center regions meet the needs of our customers globally and across both consumer workload and enterprise workloads were real data sovereignty requirements and speed the light on issues are all ready relevant having said that the way it fills up his by the value add that we can do
that 's why the mix of these higher level services especially around data and i is definitely driving a lot more consumption of our higher level services and even something like coyote they are not just add the consumption meters but they're also got saas like qualities to them so i feel very very good about ultimately having innovation
both the consumption of more higher level services and then also making sure that we are available in all parts of the world where the demand is going to spread too because we're in the very very early innings of essentially this new cloud our growth and there is only going to be increasing demand as there's more digitisation of ever
every factory and the hospital and saw on so i think we have a long way to go to still philip and i would say the way to think about that and that you see it in the gross margin percentage is that and the improvements we ve continue to see is the azure premium revenue growth excluding the overall revenue growth that actually is a benefit to the gross margin rate then again
have done through the supply chain so while we have a signal kamen you see a very quick turn from demand signal to us having servers in place and ready to be utilised very quickly that work continues and the team has on a really nice job and then as well software improvements to continue to go on to increase our a bill
run more on less those taken together continue to show gross margin improvement doubly thank you thanks very well we'll go to the next simply thank you our next question comes from line of gregg moskowitz with cowen and company please proceed okay thank you very much amy i like to follow up on heathers question because it s really difficult to grow comer
by mid single digits constant currency in the face of twenty or so declining exploration and so i'm wondering looking beyond this quarter if you could expand on how commercial bookings growth x renewals is trending in other words are you getting more separation if you will between reported growth and growth excluding renewal activity
take a shot the way i think about bookings growth every quarter as you tend to look at a couple things and i would say i start with renewals not just id we're in new the contract but how many new products new services did we add to that contractor we expand our footprint our percentage of the i t budget at a customer do they rely on us for more products and more sir
this quarter is a good example of that happening and if you think about the connection to why that happens it 's not just the terrific engineering work that we ve done in product value is also the investments that we ve made to put resources and some of these larger accounts to continue to add new workloads that are only possible in the cloud and we've add resources that we are seeing the rev uh
should in that way so that i think feels very good from a resource allocation and return perspective and so then the next component obviously as being able to grow just brand new accounts are we growing customer base is are we penetrating segment and you also saw that in the quarter so at a high level you can neither sort of add more expand
you get to add a new customer and both of those are motions that we focus on and i feel caught our execution i think there's and you'll see that dynamic so at the expiry basis a little bigger you would expect obviously a number bigger lesson that on the booking side and when expiry rates as growth is it's really about the delta between the two as you note and our execution this quarter was quite good but it s come from sustainable invest
sales technical resources and then the engineering to deliver differentiated value at the customer very helpful thank you thanks wrecked we will take the next question please thank you our next question comes from line of kash rangan with bank of america merrill lynch please proceed with the thought of my second mine on your allocated says that the mind crept to the best thing for as bright and evolve
whatever it is congratulations a serious question is cash repacked creation obviously microscope as ready to bring back a lot of money and wondering what the priorities of the company are with respect to doing a large strategic gale are not so perhaps and perhaps even share repurchases and dividends clearly is just once in a lifetime opportunity and there's a lot that can be done curious
thank you so much have actually that amy and i think this number one i would say we have when we have seen an opportunity to invest we have not really waited for tax reform to do that our opportunity to eat am really the once in a lifetime opportunity is really the technical transition
from ation that's occurring now and so we've invested to make that when we've made acquisitions when they made sense we have used the capital markets and the debt market to fund those to make sure that we made the right investments to grow our business and so for us we also didn't way when we thought about capital return even this quarter we returned
all of our free cash flow generation in dividends and share repurchase and we've been on that path for a number of years now that being said i am pleased obviously to be able to access the cash more easily and not have to go through the debt market to be able to make these choices whether its investment in ourselves and the returns use
in this quarter in revenue growth whether it s the acquisitions like lng ten that are performing better than we expected and i think today we would even say it 's a more strategic asset then we even maybe thought a year ago in terms of the power of it to add to our graph in our understanding and then be able to return capital so for me while i appreciate
spirit behind the question for us we have felt and necessity to do that for years as a part of total shareholder return and our commitment to do that and i think we've done a good job and i'm proud of what we've done and i m proud and excited for what we can continue to do <unk> <unk> corp terrific thanks so much if you cash we will take the next question please
we will move to next question please our right thank you our next question comes from line of michael in them up with credit suisse please proceed thanks for taking my question this one's for a me about the officers sixty five commercial are there any limitations other than storage related workloads that would limit office
commercial gross margin from reaching say eighty over time and what are some of the current limitations on that gross margin that you think could be improved upon for the to work higher than seventy percent over time thanks thanks you are right in general we're close like exchange and increasingly share point which we have seen some really great encouraging numbers on usage of share point in our
five consumer commercial base those do have storage requirements and so you're absolutely right they are slightly different than many of the very high level saas were closed that you see but we still do have room which i think it s really the core of the question we still have some room to improve that office three sixty five commercial gross margin from the new were
did which have even more of this pure saas like workloads and aside from office in that same segment of dynamics who are linked den with both have those saas like margins and can and we see opportunity to both improved owes as well so i dont think there is necessarily a level but there are certainly room even within the storage heavy
i mean i would just add that there is not specifically to the gross margin question of the extensive made sure of microsoft three six spots just what we think of it all up in that context amy already referenced how small businesses that perhaps never did advanced workloads are now able to do so emerging markets that never did are able to do
vault whether it's on first line work as we know had any solutions for the first find work and so there is a market expansion in terms of users and this effect accession of the local loads that they can use or the higher levels of this is the other thing is office by itself you've talked about storage it 's an interesting question to say what is being stored in office in meetings going forward
the home office or people calling in all things like mixed reality being used in meetings it 's a very different it's not about you sitting in front of word and entering taxed that's not the full limit of off as offices about any people collaborating in voice or in with even computer vision and many other raise that i think collaboration will happen
expensive you much my guy <unk> for infrastructure data i in terms of human activity that gets digitized at work and at home is something that we are going after with microsoft three six five thanks for taking my quaking thank you michael will down to our last question l please click move to <unk> corp thank you are in last question will come online of al
for jaffray please proceed hey guys thank you for taking my question so that i want to ask you about as rest acc adoption you mentioned it was head of your expectations on the call and i guess if you think about your early traction with service providers and how you are empowering them to build these as are capable data centers globally maybe longer term how should we think about the impact of this on azure hyper growth durability beyond fiscal eighteen
scale see our overall vision for how computing evolved is that it s going to be more distributed not let distributed let's just take for example what is happening in a factory in a factory one thing that is a secular is that they're putting zapata not the most senses a lot of these sensors today
rendezvous rings all of that data straight to the cloud as you do more of that what happens is you need to him and then you start doing sense of fusion which is your multiple senses that you want to be able to feuds or and take action at the speed of light gets in the way so they want local compute and so in order to have that local compute in some of these factories with millions of sensors you may in fact need
so it is not just about old workloads and service providers and essentially hybrid computing as we understand that when i think about hybrid computing at least in the fullness of time it's more of the future are distributed computing where there is a cloud there is an edge and even the edges not just one single edge but it 's got a typology associated with it going all the way to the sensors whether it s at home with its in a hospital whether it's
so where are we want to end up which is a true distributed computing fabric that the world needs in order to be a digitally transform how one quarter to quarter will they be volatility chefs changes that's all going to be the case but we we see the path of and merge pretty clearly into uh where are we need to go okay thank you
that wrapped up secured a portion of states earnings call thank you for joining us today we look forward to seeing many of you at the coming months that various investor conference for the meant it can find the details on the micro dire website thank you thank you all thank you all thanks chris thank you this concludes today's teleconference you may disconnect your lines at this time thank you for your participation
