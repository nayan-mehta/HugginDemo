two point one billion dollars our significant capital investment continues to use a store customer demand and usage signal and the teams remained focused on gross margin improvement as a deploy service services globally to meet that demand signal free cash flow grew ten percent from operating cash flow growth of eight percent as a reminder in the prior year we had one point three billion dollars and uh
equivalent positions that reverse the following quarter excluding this amount free cash flow increased twenty seven percent from higher customer collections following strong billings growth and working capital improvements in the hardware business primarily driven by our exit from the phone business other income and expense was two hundred and seventy six million dollars a little more than planned as we continued to see opportunities and the equity market to realize game throughout the quarter
our effective tax rate was eighteen percent one point lower than we expected primarily due to geographic mix of revenue this quarter we returned four point eight billion dollars to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase ers now let s turn to the q two outlook first on fx a sermon current rates remain stable we expect fx to increase revenue growth by one point costs
point and opex growth by two points our commercial business should remain healthy with solid renewal execution and increasing customer demand for our hybrid cloud services and new cloud solutions like microsoft three sixty five turning to commercial bookings as you know the underlying dollar volume of ea explorations impacts commercial bookings growth for the full year total egg
up slightly but to to exploration dollars volume will be down roughly twenty percent impacting our two q two commercial bookings growth we expect commercial on our revenue to be down approximately seven percent sequentially reflecting normal seasonality we remain committed to material improvement and in our commercial cloud gross margin percentage margin performance is variable quarter to quarter driven by rev
seasonality as well as to tire make of infrastructure spend we expect continued year over year margin improvement and sequential trends consistent with prior years next to capex we will increase our capital investment to meet growing demand and capacity needs and on the cruel dollar basis we expect a sequential dollar increase next quarter and productivity and business processes we expect rei
zero point seven five and eight point nine five billion dollars office three sixty five commercial growth will continue to outpace the transactional decline respect to more moderate rate of growth in our office consumer business given the prior year comparable in dynamics we expect continued double digit revenue growth driven by the shift dynamics three sixty five and we expect approximately one point two billion dollars of lead
reflecting continued strong sales execution by the team intelligent cloud we expect revenue between seven point three five and seven point five five billion dollars with another quarter of double digit revenue growth across server products and cloud services as a reminder starting in q two of last year the launch of windows server two thousand and sixteen drove strong on premise premises report performance resulting
constant currency growth for server products this comparable will impact the segment year over year growth rate respect enterprise services revenue growth to be similar to last quarter driven by premier support services offsetting declines in customs support agreements in more personal computing we expect revenue between zero seventy seven to twelve point one billion dollars first on windows o e m rei
attract roughly in line with the overall p c market specifically o e m pro revenue growth should be more line to commercial p c market normalizing for a couple of points of growth from a timing of licensing purchasing in the first quarter next devices and surface we expect revenue to be up slightly from q one as we continue to transition to the new service pro ramp surface laptop and launch the surface
also in november of last year we closed the sale of our future phone business so this will be the final quarter of revenue comparability impacted by the phone we expected we expect double digit revenue growth in search x tech reflecting continued strong performance in both rate and volume these finally gaming we expect revenue growth from the launch of the x box one console
healthy growth of software and services revenue in q two the higher mix of gaming hardware revenue will significantly impact both the segment and company gross margin percentage is we expect cogs between eleven and eleven point two billion dollars in the normal range for a holiday quarter with new device launches and including one point of f x headwinds this includes approximately four hundred million dollars of linked ten cogs of which two hundred
related to amortization expense we expect operating expenses of nine point one two nine point two billion dollars which includes two points of f x headwinds this includes one point one billion dollars only den expenses of which one hundred and fifty four million dollars is related to amortization other income and expense should be approximately four hundred and fifty million dollars as we continue to take games and our actually equities portfolio
expect this space to continue until the end of the fiscal year now let me share some additional comments on fiscal eighteen given our strong first quarter results our business momentum and the change in currency landscape first on fx for the full year at current rates we expect fx to increase revenue dogs and opex growth at the company level by one point
expect full year operating expense growth excluding link ten to be between four and five percent this is unchanged from our prior outlook except for the updated f x impact second on margins with our strong q one results and the f x impacts adjust outline we are trending a bit butter on both gross and operating margin relative to our original full year outlook of down
point each we now expect operating margin excellent then to be up year over year even as we increase investment to support long term top line growth in commercial cloud ai mixed reality quantum new hardware launches and the continued transformation of our sales team third tax rate were up
tax rate to twenty two percent plus or minus two points was variability due to the mix of services license revenue geographic mix of revenue and timing of equity vest and expect next quarters tax rate to comment at the midpoint of that full year range chris let s go to a thanks amy will now move to q a jetty can please repeat your instructions absolutely leaders and gentlemen at this time we will be can
and answer session again if you would like to ask a question please press star one on your phone the confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question q you may press star to if you'd like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment and may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys our first question is coming from the line of keith weiss with morgan stanley please proceed with your question
you guys for taking the question and very nice quarter saw a question for you we've been seeing intelligent cloud growing very well for quite some time azure psa standing very very impressive growth rates but even the server and tools business sustaining growth when we think about the drivers of the growth is this just continued share gains by microsoft enabling you guys to outgrow the market where have you started to see stuff like
these additional cognitive services that you bring to the market actually accelerating were clear growth within your customers you actually like building new market opportunity for yourself with these additional services thanks keith for the question and i would say all of the above one of the things that we started always we always believed in distributed computing
we built for that so when we say hybrid we never thought of it as some kind of a temporary state but we always thought the edge and the cloud was going to be where the application pattern was in fact going to get to in fact on very excited about some of the new work if i look at whether it s i r t or ai the two workloads that our new both of them require
computation and intelligence on the edge and a very new way to do even computation which is as you've been driven computation so we feel good about new workload growth we feel good about this live shift modernize motions that are happening we feel that we are well positioned for both meeting today's realities of our enterprise costa
importantly wears on a secular basis i believe our hybrid computing is going which is to this architectural baton of indulge in cloud intelligent edge thanks thanks thanks for taking next question please just <unk> corp thank you the next question is coming from the line of heather bellini with goldman sachs please proceed with your question great thank you very much i take questions related to
you guys mentioned on the call that premium services grew triple digits for the thirteenth quarter in a row now is wondering if you could give us a sense for how to think about the percentage of workloads that are now running premium services as a percentage of the total and or is that every at the point now where that's behind a percentage of the mix that were on a tipping point here where what seems like very significant
progression is going to continue at at the similar click thank you i can start and you can add to this the premium services for example the way we think about them is and everything related to our data is and especially the higher levels database says i am not talking about roth storage but this has caused most db or uh
or any of the data services are coyote services our ai services are all the premium services and there is a path every customer sometimes just starts with the infrastructure as a service and some storage and then the cliff shift turns into liver shift in more than eyes and that's where these premium services get activated so their efforts are margin uk
for off but most importantly they add a tremendous amount of value to the customers and that amy add any additional color and i think whether it gives me a good opportunity talk a little bit about the real drivers of the as the gross margin improvement there are really when you think about it three the first ones just pure revenue scale we've done such a terrific job
growing and focus saying and innovation we put in and having our sales teams through investments we've made for the past couple of years incompetency building land that at customers the second component in the one you asked about his little bit about that premium services revenue mix and you're absolutely seeing the impact of that growth as mix show up in the gross margin and
workloads satyam mentioned also bring up m as you must continue to be i think of incredible value to customers and i think we've done a very good job of pointing out is competitive advantages and we re seeing that also benefit margins and finally just a strong work and the infrastructure team both between hardware innovation done in everything from the network
way to the rocks and their integration with each other as well as the software innovation being done on top of that those things together with the premium being a component of that are all lending itself to gross margin improvement great that's very helpful thank you thanks for taking the next question please thank you our next question is coming from the line of phil winslow with wells fargo please
hi thanks guys and congrats on a great quarter just wanted to focus on on offices is obviously we spent a fair amount of time on as are the gross margins but when with an office you ve got several secular trends as well as just mix shift going on there just from our price point perspective as well as the gross margin troy in a different levels of you want to the three five so what if you forgive us some color what we re seeing their because obviously there is helping the elysee growth
pace and then it seems like margins are as well so just provides more color and what we've been seeing and kind of how you think about that trending going forward i mean let me just on the highest levels because for us again and in this last quarter the thought of the innovation that will be launched i think is also pretty key as you look forward to what it means for office and office growth one of the news
this call f one and this is about first line work so offices no longer limited just to the knowledge workers in fact we see significant opportunity for some of our team were collaboration communications as well as scheduling soft that to be very very relevant in it for anyone who's on the manufacturing plant or a retail
some of our social tools like the mn our increasingly getting used for broad communications includes a bowl skype fifteen so i just wanted to put that in in that as well as there is of course he three that is three to five i pay there is also f one which is my great increasing the overall penetration and not to mentioned the small business segment and of course all the market
dissipating with office three six five where we didn't have much if a silver business that all we sold office on premise or office perpetua clients but now you can have a small business in a country like india by office three six five as a subscription service so there's are all the things that are in play and i do think that's important keith in terms of the innovation in value i think some
on this call in particular we talk about there is installed base growth and there's a r p u increases sitting underneath that is this very large one hundred and twenty million monthly active users and commercial and they're experiencing frankly the latest innovations that the company has built so i look inside a seeing growth in that number allows us to actually grow the ah
and the new services that thought to mention continues to let us grow the installed base innovations around teams innovations in i in the actual office products themselves are now being experienced by our customers i think when you have that happen over time it builds confidence in the product in it builds confidence in in user confidence in itself and then purchasers or hap
to continue to add skews and add and move up the scale we still this is primarily the r p a growth continues to be some of the early earlier transitions we ve always talked about its that he three transition as well as installed base growth eh five continue to see encouraging signs starting to see it enter but that will take a long time as we've talked about 's actually land in our ego
we will move to next question please thank you the next question is coming from the line of karl care set with deutsche bank please proceed with your question thanks this one for anti emea just a general sort of corporate wide question on gross margins your revenue and cogs guide if i around the math correctly imply about sixty gross margins for the december quarter so that s going to be down <unk>
respect below some of the street estimates but it sounds like your tone as little bit better for gross margins for the full year so i just want to make sure i leave the call understanding what's happening here is the conclusion that to queue is somewhat of a one off given the uptick in lower margin hardware and thereafter will return to a more normal year over year pattern on gross margins
oh thanks coral actually this is really all the gaming x box one console launch it 's very specific and so every other gross margin trend across icy across p b p and across the rest of the m p c portfolio exhibits the exact same fundamental drivers and improvement
really this is really one hundred percent the x box one x impact in q two of the launch on the company gross margin and in particular the m p c gross margin to okay thanks thank you for all we will take the next question please thank you our next question comes from the line of walter pritchard with citi please proceed with your question hi
question for a me here just looking at the dependent trying to figure out the dependency of your magic growth this year on on the volume of annuity up for renewal i know last year he had very very very strong growth in annuity on that renewal cycle in you're talking about some some pressure into q two and then a slightly up trend for the year but how dependent is as our growth and customers attaching that to to the volume of annuity up
yes i would i wouldn't call it pressure walter just how i think about it there is adjusted exploration base that comes up every corner stood and and there's volatility to it so the way to think about his over the year at it 's up a little and in q two it happens to be just a low quarter of the that come up through the cycle much like q four was quite large in the sea
and as you are actually falls a couple of patterns it 's not just about ea attach although it absolutely can be one of the emotions because it tends to be project based as well and many of the investments we've made in sales capacity and the reason we did some of the sales transformation was to invest a lot more in that project led motion which is a bit disconnected
from the e a renewal cycle and you really seen that the azure pace is not if you drew a line as correlated to he says as it even was three years ago we both i think matured the product and matured our sales cycles okay great thank you thank you well for while we will go to the next question please thank you the next question is coming from the line of kirkman turn with <unk>
i please proceed with your question uh thanks very much in all my congrats on the quarter saw th yesterday you are down at the g event and announcing the partnership with them around predicts and i was wondering when we think about the opportunities for as you are to be that sort of trusted platform prize these can you just talk about how you think the progress is going on that front because it seems to obviously just to keep
ham the kind of use cases you can address by bringing partners like g onto your platform thanks <unk> corp now thank you for the question overall i think you sort of speak too i think one of the big advantages and one of the big value propositions we have on both sides one is to the enterprise customer we are a trusted partner and we support them with their hybrid computing
i needs one of the things that we emphasizes it 's not about our technology but it s or ability to transfer that capability to our customer because they're increasingly becoming whether you're in retail or you're in oil and gas or are you in financial services everyone to them it is trying to build our own software capability and we're uniquely capable of doing so the second part is the eye us we we now
big areas of investment this year was the core cell capacity nor field so that i as we can be successful on our platform but that it s g or adobe and many others in all now benefit both because of our enterprise partnership and credibility and more importantly because of the field resources we are put in place so we're really looking forward to accelerating our business
the g and many others to come but it s a very important course cell motion and more importantly building trust on both sides of the to question <unk> corp thanks thank you will take the next question please
thank you the next question is coming from the line of mark martin or with bernstein please proceed with your question thanks for taking my question in again congrats on the quarter fled to look at the dynamics three hundred sixty five it 's been growing release as it was center stage it in vision in almost every presentation in discussion can you talk more about how you think about the opportunity and give us a sense of of which is
right now within three hundred sixty five percent with its here i'm a talent or european whatever our driving the growth and could be part of the future growth thanks thank you for that question the way we designed dynamics three six five both on the technology front as well as than the business model front what's to get away from what i would describe as the old school sweet based selling or sweet bay
these things whether it's cr amery rb you're s c m because we realized that for example you take any i r t project that is starting in asia it first translates into on analytics workload that pulls through some azure higher order analytics services and then immediately after you do something like preventive maintenance you need field service and
is just a very robust field service module that s cost effective inefficient and so we're able to attach that too that project are similarly on talent they want to be able to you if you start on linked in with the hiring you want to be able to do the onboarding in palenque a management dots the module knew what even into operation side we realizing that even if you keep your financial the same there is need
reesing digitisation that is more operational modules that you need so that s what we have designed it for to the growth is actually across the board it 's coming in customer service it's coming in our sales it 's coming in talent it 's coming in operations and we have some very competitive price points that the auto one is that there is no such thing as a canonical been
as a canonical business in time that means teams are always changing so customization customization and composition especially with the office three six five is very important this is where we have some very differentiated offer with power be i paul or apps and flow and that s another big driver of some of that growth across our enterprise customers thanks mark thank you banks will be
thank you our next question is coming from the line of atom hold with moffett nathanson please proceed with your question hi everyone that was that was some quarter intended to ask about the strength in windows which i know you don t talk about much and much questions about but really since we've we've launched the question and i get by far the most is around the long term margin potential
and with the gross margins being as good as they were this quarter without giving this long term guidance is there any reason to believe that that the long term operating margins in azure couldn't be we saw a to b s put up a mid twenties operating margin is reading structural to that will lead us to believe it couldn t do something in that range or how should we think about the long term framework for that business
i mean i would start out i'm the one thing i would say is one i think about the long term margin i actually think of the long term margin across on cloud i mean when we even make our capex decisions which is one of the drivers of margin we think golf first twofold first body equal stood body lot of what we do even in wyndham most people
with one of the most important services we run its windows update as a cloud service and so we have a lot of value that is across the board cloud services whether it's x box live windows update office three six five dynamics three six five and of course all of the asian services and we are going to build scale across all of them and so we would not in fact we
aggressive in taking margin in one place we different as we see a path to margin under a different spots that s something that we want to make sure we follow more opportunity in a customer across the board was just trying to micro manage to sydney margins in very specific opportunities because we think that it s the integrated ability for us to deliver val
is which i think long term is what customers expect a microsoft and i would just add that as we think about that long term trajectory our ability to continue to improve margins in our saas portfolio in our passport full in as portfolio so access and our ability to blend i'm into interesting products that sold customer solutions which may not even be priced as the component parts
as i think how we think about especially our solution areas that saw the you'll talks about how we talk about the delivering it to a customer so while i am confident and our ability to continue to grow the core margin i do think for us in particular it really is a portfolio that we believe that we need to manage appropriately great thank you thank
next question thank you the next question is coming from the line of michael nemeroff with credit suisse please proceed with your question hi thanks for taking my question my question is on the gaming business given even larger focus you're putting on the segment in the near term how quickly or in what timeframe do you think gaming revenue could grow at or above the average gaming industry growth rate of mid to high single digits and i know you don t breakout segment margins ba
sense of how you think about gaming from a normalized contribution margin perspective relative to m p c and your overall company wide margins excluding the onetime x box launch affects thanks i'll bet i can start again i would say from a gaming perspective one of the big up our changes that has happened in the last outs a couple of years is one of course the wide once
live net to walk across the pc and the console and now increasingly even on the phone because of titles like mine craft
once you have been network you have plenty of different opportunities in particular we now have a subscription for with the game past that s off to a very good start and our goal is to be able to have essentially on netflix for gains so that we can have the games subscriptions that cannot people can use across all of the devices that they play in the other areas story
there is game playing and game watching and those secular growth on both fronts and we feel very very good about the engagement increases in a pretty unique value proposition we have in mix so that s an another opportunity that we believe will shape in addition to things like the sports and sought so it's the totality of that and what one of the numbers that i didn't put in my script
d percent growth in what we called software and services that s perhaps a leading indicator of where we think that the opportunity life these are early days for us but that said that's probably one of the key numbers to watch as we make progress in executes and because of that you're actually already seeing that impact in the m p c gross margins even this
great example there was materials improvement in gross margin in that segment and a lot of that was actually due to the higher margins that we have structurally and that software and services revenue from acts box and as i believe the industry is thought you were talking about pivots to be more about the engagement and monetization of that member network you can expect that
as well of our traditional more hardware focused x box to evolve to be a real combination of those two things going forward and structurally that would of course of higher higher operating margins <unk> corp thank you very much thanks we will take the next question please thank you our next question is coming from the line of rameau luncheon with barclays please proceed with your
he thanks for taking my question if the composition we have on around as you are after an adoption seems to be changing the customers were they seem to be to seeking a deeper relationship with you guys now given that your and maturity has increased quite a bit over the last your course can you talk to that is that s something that just i picked up where is what using in your customer relations in your contributions as well thank you
hopefully be picked it up a lot earlier than you did we have so we do have a very different dialogue if you think about it all of the customers that we have worked with we've always worked with them historically even in october days are but to your point re more i think what has happened as the change even in the financial services this
represent the kinds of workloads now that are moving to the cloud has qualitatively changed in the past we participated but a lot of tier one workloads were not on microsoft stack where is now a lot of tier one workloads are in fact increasingly on microsoft plowed and so to me that represents a qualitative change
and so the type of dialogue we have whether it is with an auto company or a financial services company or retail company is much deeper much broader and i would use the word we are deeply partnering with them it's no longer just simple vendor relationships because as they're trying to build it on software capability they need a trusted partner who is more interested in making sure that their build their own tech
ability and that's what we are investing in and i would say rameau away to think about this is we've always had that trusted relationship which were incredibly proud of as a as a company with our enterprise customers the investments we've made over the past years are about hiring the type of talent that can go and sit with a customer and drive the customers successful outcomes of the projects they deploy
mean it's about the investments we've made in capability the evolution of the product and innovation and i think using and trying to continue to earn the customer process to deliver these world class for clothes so i do think this is really an output of multiple years of concentration on on delivering that capability thank you <unk> corp thank you very well
i for one more question please <unk> corp thank you our last question comes from the line of rock macmillan with r b c capital markets please proceed with your question thanks for taking my question such a i was curious you've made a number of announcements with adobe over the last year so when it seems like microsoft products and uh there will be s products are getting more intertwined and
i'm just curious from your perspective if you could just maybe give us some insights into where you see big opportunities to work with the vendor like adobe and what are they go to market actions that you are seeing being more successful thank you all are all very excited about the partnership it the adobe and as you said uh there will be in microsoft apartment in fact across
histories are in many of the areas but are increasingly across the creative cloud and net document cloud as well as their experience cloud we have plenty going on and fact will be a very excited about what are we are doing with our devices and adobe and with windows because i think windows and windows ten creators update
platform for all of the creators in the world because of the innovation in windows in the innovation in devices both such his book as well as our o e m devices so that's one area that i think you will see i would love if you're in illustrator are up photoshop user you should just check out the dial support that they have it so business just just beautiful and then you go to office three six five we have a partner
signatures we have good interoperability between our respective documents clouds that will in fact continue and then on the on the creative side or on the experience side in fact we're adding a lot of data and i capability which is obviously key to adobe as an eye as we so we are looking forward to the ultimately the impact all this has with customers in terms
d to take advantage of our respective value and for them to be able to benefit from it all and so these kinds of partnerships whether that adobe or others we are very focused on making sure that i us fees and partners have success on our platforms and that's sort of our core heritage and that s something that we want to absolutely focus on thanks thank you rough
