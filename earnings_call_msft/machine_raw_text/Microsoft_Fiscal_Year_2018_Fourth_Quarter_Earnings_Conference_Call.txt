lower than anticipated do a stronger u s dollars at the segment level fx had a positive impact of three points on productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud and one point on more personal computing revenue the f x impact to calm with immaterial this quarter operating expenses grew nine percent and eight percent in constant currency above our expectations due to revenue driven expense so

in the commercial space we saw an accelerating pace of windows ten enterprise deployments this quarter customer demand for modern and secure hardware and stronger than expected pc growth in geographies were pro mixes high contributed to o e m revenue growth fourteen percent ahead of the overall commercial markets windows commercial products and cloud services were two thousand
nineteen percent in constant currency driven by double digits billings growth as well as a higher mix of in quarter recognition from multiyear agreements and consumer oh you have non per revenue declined three percent slightly below the consumer piecing market driven by continued pressure in the entry level price category even as we continue to take share in the premium category inventory levels were within the normal range
revenue x tax three seventeen percent of sixteen percent in constant currency driven by enhancements to our advertising platform and being volume growth to across both us and international markets service revenue increased twenty five percent to twenty one percent in constant currency driven by strong performance but the latest additions in the portfolio against the low prior year comparable and gaming revenue

us additions offset by sales mix to lower margin businesses operating expenses grew nine percent and eight percent in constant currency driven by seasonality changes in advertising stand versus the prior year and investments and engineering across search and ai operating income grew thirty eight percent and thirty two percent the constant currency now back to total company results
capital expenditures including financially says were four point one billion dollars and increased on sequential basis in line with expectation cash pay for properties plant and equipment was four billion dollars reflecting investments to support growth in our comp business as well as of two hundred and fifty million dollars real estate acquisition free cash flow was seven point four billion dollars and down fifteen percent year over year
flexing higher capital expenditures in support of our comp business cash flow from operations for four percent year over year and included tax payments related to the adoption of a sc six oh six and key cj as well as an earlier start to the hardware inventory built for holiday than in the prior year excluding the impact of these items operating cash flow grew approximately thirteen
driven by strong cloud billings and collections other income and expense was approximately three hundred million dollars lower than expected due to f x remeasurement our non g a a p effective tax rate was eighteen percent higher than anticipated due to the geographic mix of our revenue and finally we return five point three billion dollars to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases an increase of sixteen purse
our q four share repurchase with two point one billion dollars of thirty one percent your year but down sequentially given the suspension of share repurchase activity in advance of the announced to get help acquisition now was moved to the outlook
terry for both the full year end next quarter does not include any impact from get up which we still expect to clues for the end of accounting year overall the key drivers and trends of our business for the next fiscal year remained largely unchanged from april and assume the consistent macro environment first on fx assuming that rates remain stable we expect no impact to full year revenue
with any fx benefits in h one offset in h two fx should decrease costs and operating expense growth by one point set our commercial business given corporate i can't spend optimism an increasing demand for cloud services our strong competitive product position and consistent sales execution we expect another year of
growth and higher annuity next across commercial business as customer commitment to our cloud increases we are seeing a larger and longer term agreements as a result we make the increased quarterly volatility in commercial bookings growth and commercial on our revenue productivity and this is process and should continue to grow double digit driven by office three sixty five dynamics truth
and like den customer demand for our hybrid offering should draw high teams growth in our server products and cloud services k p i and an average specifically we expect an increasing mix of i asked in past consumption based revenue in window we expect strong business fundamental in our o e m pro and windows commercial businesses though the rates of revenue growth
year against a strong fy eighteen comparable third commercial cloud gross margin percentage we expect continued improvement in each commercial cloud service as well as in the overall commercial cloud gross margin percentage the rate of improvement will moderate relative to fy eighteen as revenue mix continues to shift azure i asked intact assumption based services uh
last year over year improvement in our power user services we will continue to increase our investments in capex to meet growing demand for our cloud services although we do it back to growth rate for the year to moderate next operating expenses given our strong execution we will continue to invest in the trends and growing markets we believe our fundamental to long term shareholder value
investment in commercial cloud like ten gaming and a i should result in operating expense growth of roughly seven percent even with these strategic investments and the continued shift to our cloud businesses we expect operating margin to be up slightly year over year other income expects to be slightly negative in line with prior guidance and with quarterly
primarily due to changes in f x remeasurement interest rates and valuation changes with the adoption of the new accounting rules financial investments and finally tax rate we ever find our estimates of the impacts from q c j a the mix of service versus like to the revenue and the geographic mix of revenue and now expect our fy nineteen effective tax rate to be roughly seventeen percent with
ability now to the outlook for the first quarter first fx assuming corporates remains stable we expect x two increased revenue growth for the fox mutely one point and decrease costs operating expenses by one point second our commercial business we expect another healthy quarter with commercial on our revenue down approximately ten percent sequentially in la
seasonality commercial cloud gross margin percentage will improve slightly on a sequential basis serve we expect another quarter of sequential growth in capital expenditures as we continue to support growing global customer demand now the segment guidance in productivity and business processes we expect revenue to nine point two five billion euros nine point four or five billion and driven by
growth and office commercial and dynamics linked in revenue growth should remain high on a stronger prior year comparable in intelligent cloud we expect revenue twenty eight point one five point seven zero eight point three thousand five billion dollars as a revenue growth to reflect a balance of continued strength in our i often path consumption based services and a moderating growth rate of growth in our per use
in more personal computing we expect revenue between nine point nine five and ten point two five billion dollars e m pro we expect revenue growth in line with the commercial p c market and o e m non pro we expect similar dynamic sixteen in q four in surface we continue to expect strong performance from related additions including the new surface co
grow similar to q one of the prior year search x tax just see another quarter of mid teens growth with consistent execution it gets rate and volume growth opportunities in gaming we expect mid teens revenue growth with continued strong user engagement on our platform his offering services growth rate with moderate due to strong third party titles launched a year ago
we expect cost nine point five billion to nine point seven billion dollars and operating expenses of nine point two percent to nine point three billion dollars other income and expense is expected to be approximately negative one hundred million dollars and finally we expect our q one effective tax rate to be slightly lower than our full year rate due to volumes equity vest to take place during our first quarter mike let's go duke
thanks to me will number of the q a operator can you please repeat your instructions corp thank you ladies and gentlemen at this time will be conducting the question and answer session to ask a question please press star one on your telephone key pad the confirmation tone will indicate that your line is in the question q you may press star to if we'd like to remove your question from the queue for participants using speaker equipment and may be necessary to pick up your handset is there more pressing the star
our first question is coming from a line of keith weiss with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions i cannot thank you guys for taking the question and congratulations on a really nice quarter i wanted to dig into azure a little bit i think growth overall on average this quarter is probably head of most people's expectations and it sounds like the the type of business is being done on azure is becoming more strategic and changing a
satya i was hoping you know talked with a little bit about the types of workloads the type of sort of services that are being used on azure had that evolved over the past year and amy for maybe a new safety i believe you gave us sort of the growth in the enterprise mobility of fifty five percent was that in line with your expectations because i know you're sort of temper ring our expectations on growth net part of the business is that growing in line with
you were expecting or does that are than you had imagined yes so what plausible thanks piece of the question insolvency stock overall in terms with the well colored mix
being fairly stable which is our hybrid value proposition really has continued to resonate so that means there is a bunch of well clothes that are migrating to the cloud people use both as your stock plus azure so that continues to drive a lot of last growth for us as people sort of looking basically to lift in shift a lot
data center workloads then on top of it we even have more than as a nation of apps that is accelerating and that drives a lot of the higher level services in particular our data services as well as our prices but when i sat with because their attention to compute but what happens is all this computer then requires storage and data and that s an another place where we see
acceleration the one thing that i would say that i am increasingly c s g a one will close in some sense when you think about some of the commitments be made buckle on the biggest brands in the world in terms of what they're doing one its very core do that operation and to their running even the clock and so that's one thing that definitely the market difference for us
now on the per user services specifically enterprise mobility keep it was a bit better than i had anticipated in q four and related driver of these per user services such as e m ask actually is the value proposition that top tier refers to we refer to as microsoft three sixty five and we saw strength broadly and if you think about
windows commercial his office three sixty five commercial and e m s and really that i think what we heard a lot was value of security and management continue to add more supported endpoints also really tremendous value to customers and we did see a bit more strength that i was anticipating in q four thanks thanks to all thank you
enough thank you the next question is coming from the line of colonel care said with deutsche bank please proceed thank you congrats on a good quarter amy the commercial unearned revenue and bookings were again super strong and evidently microsoft is benefiting from fairly strong he a renewal activity so when you look out into fiscal two thousand and nine nineteen how would you compare the deer
activity versus fiscal two thousand and eighteen and fiscal seventeen it sounds like you are still constructive but i'd love to hear some color whether it feels as good as the fiscal year you just ended thank you thank car let me break up that question a little bit because you actually as a couple of things that are important number one the on our in straw
all at the end of q four you are right was very good execution on renewals i reasonably large renewal base but there was also a very good execution of adding new workload adding new opportunity in q four things such as as or as an example or dynamics three sixty five thousand
so really q four wasn't joss renewal activity it was also new workflows in new value so when you look into nineteen i am optimistic on both of those france good execution continuing our our new tools as well as adding new value and new opportunity and the third
the question was really how do they renewal base correlates fy eighteen answer if it's a little bigger but it actually has the same amount of volatility quarter to quarter so q ones renewal bases actually almost equivalent to last year cut okay great helpful color i mean thank you thanks for all operating will take the next
thank you the next question is coming from the line of heather bellini with goldman sachs please proceed with your question great thank you i was wandering off your sought get it if you can help us think about how azure hybrid benefit has changed that type of the net expansion rate you're experiencing on your e l that come up for renewal and i know you were kind of a little bit touching on that with car
help think about how that in particular might be helping the expansion rate to those accounts and can you help us think about how this might be how that might be helping drive growth in your existing contracts and then the other question would be you mentioned debt you're moving from per user consumption that you are going to see more growth in consumption based services versus per
azure workload growth and im just kind of wondering if you could share with this is there any gross margin impact their does one have higher gross margins than the others there anything that we should be taking from how your parsing those comments about how we think of azure gross margin progression going forward thanks whether so on the first one i actually think that these hybrid huge benefits and been sort of the best kept secret
hoping that going into this next fiscal year we do a much better job and customers do a much better job for their own benefit because the the advantage as you have because of the hybrid use benefits across the under workloads operating phenomenon when we had a good set of sessions that partner meeting this week just really making sure everybody uh
benefit so i dont think that that is really played a few six am using all the growth we are seeing in spite of that not being broadly really driving growth but to your second question i will even say the falling which is that i think there is clearly a different in gm between the poor user and consumption but the key is even the consumption services calm and if
is the iss there is the data services and some of the higher level services some of these iowa to services now even have saas components to it so therefore i think that mix will be different by quarter by quarter but increasingly all strategy is in many times to get customers to get going with what is core storage our core compute
am into these higher level services and i would say have on those two components just to add the over hybrid benefits i think we re starting us off to say we started to impact from that in my opinion in q four in the on prem katy i but it really was more in windows
you as we continue to see in sequel next year i do think there is some opportunity for customers to realize real value from these hybrid benefits and so as to add confident to my high teens k p i growth for the year is that this is a very customer value oriented offer to your question on gm talk is ah
correct on that one and i would say the way we think about it is actually more worth of azure per user if it really does move more with him three sixty five per user it s almost prior to put that in your mind is behaving more and having margin structure is more like office three sixty five and behave quite similar way
have good quarters when we do good execution an office three sixty five and so my comments were more and continue to be around having people understand that sales motion and it tends to news in that direction thank you thanks better we are moving the next question please thank you the next question is coming from a line of march for dollar with bernstein research please proceed with your question that congratulations
thanks for taking my questions so i have to related questions the first is if you look at this quarter intelligent cloud revenue grew twenty three percent and the gross margin dollars good with the same twenty three percent given the fast growing lower margin azure business we're not seeing any longer negative margin impact have you reached the point where the incremental dollars azure revenue is close to the oh
in cloud gross margins and then a second apologize quite long question capex spending in the quarter in the full year we're both strong we could argue two possibilities here is driven by all the capacity by the demand or you're having to spend a lot of it on replacing equipment as their aging out how should we think about the mix in capex between building man and replacing one second thanks
let me take both is on the first one in terms of the gm this quarter to rights the improvements particularly or in the i asked of tasks gross margin of azure did offset the cloud mix to azure within the segment going forward continuing to see that i think we'll see
on gross margin just because the amount of azure in the mix after rate it's growing we're still not at that point where a dollar of gross margin in the cloud is equivalent to a dollar on of on prem that being said we have a lot so as you saw this quarter we re doing to grow gross margin dollars in that even within the
into fy nineteen your second question in terms of capital spent if you think about it at at a high level our capital expenditures are growing at a lower rates in our overall cloud revenue was growing and that s why you're starting to see leverage right flow through the p and l and think that the rate of capex growth as i said in fy nineteen will
that happens because of course we're doing some were placement but we're also adding regions and seeing a lot of global demand and so we're actually and improving margin so i think that's put a very high level at the as you asked a question i tend to think revenues growing faster than than my capital youre seeing leverage through the p and l and we'll see a moderating rate in fy nineteen
one is a big quarter it just it's just going to be volatile as capex tends to be quarter to quarter based on both supply chain and demand that really bricks thank you greg the thanks mark operator will take the next question please thank you the next question is coming from the line of walter pritchard with sitting please proceed hi amy wondering on on the office
products and services on the commercial side you had i think eight percent growth below as you've seen i know six and six drive some volatility in that in that business can you help us understand what drove out in the quarter and i know you're making some changes like the support and so forth is getting into the out years there any impact that you expect to see the growth rate net business as we look forward from from those changes thanks wells from the entire impacts in
i actually feel very good about that number because if you think about billion plus dollar fee we had to the unearned it was partially due to the fact that we have very good mix shift to office three sixty five percent in terms of billings in the quarter almost very little of that gets recognized in the quarter almost all those to the balance sheet
so my confidence for f zero dollars and continue in that number being the double digits we talked about in the full year guide only gets raised by seeing that execution so it is really six hundred six related is the way to think about it plus a mix with billings and billing strengths so i don t really do about that as big and negative and you saw the exact same behavior in diane
so it's a pretty similar in period in quarter impacts great thanks walter will take the next question please our next question is coming from the line of phil when flow with wells fargo please proceed with your question hey yeah thanks for taking my grand question and congrats on a great quarter integrate fiscal year amy question for you you commented on on the positive spread that you're seeing and the window
o e m business but overall but particularly on on mic on the commercial side would you start to think forward on the actually call a couple of quarters you're obviously told us what the positive drivers were but how do you see those were playing out in can we maintain that positive spread and and it s a wide and if it does maybe narrow how do you think about the narrow the shore let me frame the first as the things that
we are seeing really customer driven which is if you start with windows ten and the value the customer stay and what we are seen is accelerating enterprise deployments windows ten when that happens it does create demand for new devices and modern devices that improved security
so that then in turn results in a better and stronger overall o e m p c commercial market in addition because of the macroeconomic conditions are actually quite good on this front and with some business optimism at creating some winded our back i also think people looking say it s security and value are important this is a great time to uh
modern pcs and particularly in markets were pro mix has been strong i continue to expect to see all of those things capex through the course of next year now what you will see however it all those things even do remain true which i expect them to if the economic environment stays the same day
where we ve had really strong revenue growth and a really strong market will i think moderate growth wives just because the base it was coming off of and seventeen was just a lot slower so even if i see all the good things in good trends happening that i feel i'll really create a great opportunity for us to selling microsoft three sixty five
growth rates moderate make sure that that's very helpful thanks thanks operator will take our next question please thank you the next question is coming from the line of ramo luncheon with barclays please proceed with your question he thanks for taking my question amy chemical back to the survey product that you partly and such it with the when ever ask and i
hybrid club will be a factor here but the grow for us the best we've seen for a long time can you just talk about the driver s that kind of where i have play here thank you thank you for your right the first one was the benefits that we saw hybrid in particular with an outsize impact on windows server the second has been a trend we also have talked about a little bit
we saw strong double digit growth in the radio so we'll go the mix shift as well as i think strength in the hyper benefits as a value prop to customers those two are there are the ones i would actually call out his driver's for the quarter i mean you should be relatively sustainable if i listen to them to you i believe in the one
think really important thing for us is continuing to focus on creating customer value the concept of adding a lot of value for having and giving comfort to a customer that as they make a commitment to the microsoft platform that they can move between a commitment to on prem to the cloud and over high value way i do believe is
unique things that we offer at this time for commercialization we will take next question please thank you the next question is coming from the line of gregg moskowitz with cowen and company please proceed with your question okay thank you very much such a this is more of a big picture question but over a longer term period im curious how large you think edge computing will become relative peace
getting thanks yeah i mean i think vision that we have always had is that distributed computing in some sense it will remain distributed so we don't flick this in do there's an edge computing that the cloud computing the need for computing is on a secular basis going to increase and as you need to reason over large amounts of data
not only storage and compute to be co located on noble as the gold and get them vetted with the computing that s what we are building so if you think about our real competitive advantage in to fancy issue is we are one programming model one identity model security management so that more than developers as well as he can use the computer way lable from agis feel
and the reality is these modern workloads in fact lose it all so it's not like i just build an azure sphere application i build an application that's fundamentally distributed but also happens to run some computer on azure of sphere that i think the future which is distributed computing going back to what needs to be truly distributed even driven sober less even worse this thing
how one time migration to something new expense thank you very much thanks greg operator will take the next question please thank you our next question is coming from the line of keith often with banks montreal please proceed with your question hi thanks very much saute i wanted to direct this to you if i could i'd like to understand how you view dynamics current positioning
compared to the market opportunities in the context of the question is dynamics remains a fairly small part of microsoft revenues as well if you look at the market share ware dynamic serve it 's a fairly small part of the market served so what do you think microsoft needs to do to have a larger impact against the market opportunities for overall we are
very committed in very bullish about the opportunity in dynamics we've done an x g e six five for example what are your even to seeing in the last fiscal year
the first the first full fiscally where we have does more than montjeu the approach to business applications i think it s very disruptive in the marketplace because it brings a very different value proposition it has a price advantage in the value advantage full cost of most and any what is fundamentally a fragmented mark this is not business applications and that will
